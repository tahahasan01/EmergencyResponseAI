# 🚀 CrisisSim Quick Start Guide

## When Your Groq API Rate Limit Resets...

### Step 1: Switch to Real API
Edit `.env` file:
```bash
# Change from:
LLM_PROVIDER=mock

# To:
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
```

### Step 2: Run Full Experiments
```bash
# This will run all 60 experiments (3 maps × 4 strategies × 5 seeds)
python run_all_experiments.py
```

This will automatically:
- ✅ Run 60 experiments 
- ✅ Save results to `results/raw/`
- ✅ Generate `results/agg/summary.csv`
- ✅ Create all required plots in `results/plots/`
- ✅ Save conversation logs to `logs/`

### Step 3: Take Screenshots
```bash
# Start the GUI server
python server.py

# Then open http://127.0.0.1:8522 in your browser
# Take screenshots during different simulation phases
```

### Step 4: Verify Results
Check that you have:
- 📁 `results/raw/` - 60 JSON files
- 📁 `results/agg/summary.csv` - Aggregated metrics
- 📁 `results/plots/` - All required plots
- 📁 `logs/strategy=*/run=*/` - Conversation logs
