## Abstract

Disaster response operations require rapid decision-making under uncertainty, making them ideal candidates for agentic AI systems. This paper presents CrisisSim, a comprehensive simulation framework that evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based planning strategies for coordinating rescue operations. We implemented four distinct reasoning frameworks: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), Reflexion (memory-based planning with critique), Chain-of-Thought (step-by-step reasoning), and Plan-and-Execute (strategic two-phase planning). The system integrates with Groq and Gemini APIs, features six environmental extensions including battery systems, hospital triage, and dynamic aftershocks, and provides real-time visualization through an enhanced GUI. Experimental evaluation across three difficulty maps with five random seeds each (60 total experiments) demonstrates that ReAct achieves the highest rescue success rate (73.2%), while Reflexion shows superior fire suppression capabilities (89.1% effectiveness). The framework successfully handles schema enforcement, invalid JSON recovery, and resource constraints, providing insights into LLM-based decision making under crisis conditions.

## 1. Introduction

Disaster response scenarios present complex, time-critical decision-making challenges that traditional rule-based systems struggle to address effectively. The dynamic nature of crisis situations—with rapidly changing conditions, resource constraints, and competing priorities—demands adaptive intelligence capable of reasoning under uncertainty. Agentic AI systems, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer compelling advantages over deterministic approaches by providing natural language reasoning, contextual understanding, and flexible problem-solving capabilities.

Traditional rule-based disaster response systems rely on predetermined decision trees and static protocols, limiting their adaptability to novel situations. In contrast, LLM-based agents can interpret complex scenarios, weigh multiple objectives, and generate contextually appropriate responses. This flexibility becomes crucial when dealing with emergent behaviors, resource depletion, and the need for strategic replanning as conditions evolve.

The motivation for this work stems from the critical question: **which reasoning approach works best for AI systems under pressure?** Different cognitive frameworks represent fundamentally different ways AI systems can process information and make decisions. In crisis scenarios, this choice becomes crucial—the wrong reasoning approach could mean the difference between successful rescues and tragic losses.

While a single simulation environment might seem redundant with multiple frameworks, each represents a distinct cognitive approach to decision-making:

- **ReAct mimics human expert thinking**: "observe, reason, act, reflect" patterns used by experienced emergency responders
- **Reflexion represents organizational learning**: building institutional memory from past disasters to improve future responses
- **Chain-of-Thought follows systematic analysis**: methodical step-by-step problem solving under pressure
- **Plan-and-Execute mirrors command structures**: strategic planning followed by tactical execution, common in military and emergency management

CrisisSim addresses these challenges by providing a controlled experimental platform for comparative AI research. The system enables direct evaluation of reasoning approaches while accounting for real-world constraints such as API reliability, parsing errors, and resource limitations—factors often overlooked in theoretical AI research but critical for deployment in actual emergency situations.

**This work contributes to understanding which AI reasoning patterns perform best under different crisis conditions, providing insights valuable for both academic research and practical emergency management applications.**

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Architecture Pipeline

CrisisSim follows a perception-reasoning-action cycle that mirrors real-world crisis response operations:

```
World State → Situation Assessment → LLM Planner → JSON Commands → Action Execution → Updated World State
```

**Core Components:**
- **Environment Engine**: Mesa-based multi-agent simulation with 20×20 to 30×30 grids
- **LLM Planning Module**: Strategy dispatcher supporting four reasoning frameworks
- **API Client Layer**: Unified interface for Groq (Llama-3.3-70b) and Gemini (1.5-flash)
- **GUI Visualization**: Real-time WebSocket-based interface with comprehensive statistics
- **Logging System**: JSONL conversation logs and CSV metrics aggregation

### 2.2 Provided vs. Implemented Components

**Provided Foundation:**
- Basic Mesa simulation framework
- Initial agent classes (Drone, Medic, Truck)

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 LLM Planning Strategies

**Framework Design Philosophy**: Each reasoning framework represents a distinct cognitive approach to crisis decision-making, designed to test different aspects of LLM reasoning under pressure.

#### 3.1.1 ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Observe Environment → Reason About Situation → Act with Commands → Reflect on Outcomes
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def react_plan(context, scratchpad=""):
    prompt = f"""
    CRISIS RESPONSE PLANNING - ReAct Framework
    
    Current Situation: {context['summary']}
    Available Agents: {context['agents']}
    Objectives: Rescue survivors, extinguish fires, clear roads
    
    Think step by step:
    1. OBSERVE: What is the current crisis situation?
    2. REASON: What are the most urgent priorities?
    3. ACT: What specific commands should I give?
    
    Previous Actions: {scratchpad}
    
    FINAL_JSON: {{"commands": [...]}}
    """
```

**Stopping Criteria:** Plan generation terminates when valid JSON is extracted or after 3 retry attempts.

**Decision Example:** Fire spreading toward 3 survivors
```
"I observe 3 survivors at risk from spreading fire. I reason that 
immediate evacuation takes priority over fire suppression. I act by 
sending all medics to survivors. I reflect - this direct approach 
worked effectively, continue similar patterns."
```

#### 3.1.2 Reflexion (Memory-Based Planning)

**Flow Diagram:**
```
Plan → Execute → Critique Performance → Update Memory → Improved Planning
```

**Memory System:**
- Maintains success/failure patterns across episodes
- Tracks effective strategies for different scenarios  
- Incorporates lessons learned from previous planning errors

**Critique Template:**
```python
critique_prompt = f"""
Analyze the previous planning attempt:
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What patterns should be remembered?
Provide specific recommendations for future planning.
"""
```

**Decision Example:** Applying lessons from previous failure
```
"Last time we prioritized fire suppression and lost 2 survivors.
Memory suggests prioritize survivors with low deadlines first. 
This run, dispatch medics immediately and assign truck to create
fire barriers only after evac routes are established."
```

#### 3.1.3 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

**Sequential Reasoning Structure:**
```
Problem Analysis → Resource Assessment → Priority Ranking → Strategy Formation → Command Generation
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def cot_plan(context, scratchpad=""):
    prompt = f"""
    Let's think through this crisis response step by step:
    
    Step 1: Analyze the current emergency situation
    Step 2: Assess available resources and constraints
    Step 3: Rank survivors and threats by urgency
    Step 4: Formulate optimal resource allocation
    Step 5: Generate specific agent commands
    
    FINAL_JSON: {{"commands": [...]}}
    """
```

**Decision Example:** Methodical analysis under pressure
```
"Step 1: 3 survivors (deadlines: 15, 30, 45 ticks), 1 fire spreading 15%/tick
Step 2: 2 medics available, 1 truck with 80 water units
Step 3: Survivor A most urgent (15 ticks), fire threatens Survivor B route
Step 4: Medic 1→Survivor A, Medic 2→Survivor B, Truck→fire suppression
Step 5: Move commands with calculated shortest paths"
```

#### 3.1.4 Plan-and-Execute

**Two-Phase Architecture:**
```
Phase 1: Strategic Planning → Phase 2: Tactical Execution
```

**Strategic Phase:** High-level resource allocation and objective prioritization
**Tactical Phase:** Specific command generation based on strategic decisions

**Decision Example:** Command structure approach
```
Strategic Plan: "Immediate survivor extraction priority, establish 
fire containment perimeter, maintain supply lines to depot"

Tactical Execution: "Deploy Medic Alpha to Survivor 1 via route [3,4][4,5], 
Medic Beta to Survivors 2&3, Truck Charlie provides fire barrier at [8,9]"
```

### 3.2 LLM API Integration

**Provider Configuration:**
- **Groq API**: Llama-3.3-70b-versatile model, temperature=0.1, max_tokens=2048
- **Gemini API**: Gemini-1.5-flash model, temperature=0.1, safety_settings=minimal

**Error Handling Pipeline:**
```python
async def call_llm(prompt, provider="groq", retries=3):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            response = await api_call(prompt, provider)
            return validate_json_response(response)
        except RateLimitError:
            await exponential_backoff(attempt)
        except JSONParseError:
            prompt = add_json_recovery_instructions(prompt)
    return fallback_plan()
```

**Schema Enforcement:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "commands": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "agent_id": {"type": "integer"},
          "action": {"type": "string", "enum": ["move", "rescue", "extinguish", "clear", "recharge"]},
          "target": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "integer"}}
        }
      }
